"# Hydration-Manager" 

This project seeks to aid the athletic training staff at the University of South Carolina.
Currently, the training staff is using pencil and paper method of tracking water weight loss, weighing athletes before and after practice.
They then plug in this data into an excel spreadsheet, which calculates hydration statuses of the athletes.
The purpose of Hydration-Manager is to move this process into an online, web-based application that will alert the staff immediately if athletes are dehydrated,
thus improving their response time to cases of severe dehydration and promoting the overall health and capacity of the student athletes.

Please check out our wiki for information regarding this application!
